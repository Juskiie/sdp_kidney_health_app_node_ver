    <h2>About CKD</h2>
    <p>Chronic kidney disease or CKD is the medical term used to cover a wide range of conditions that result in long-term kidney damage. A staging system is used to classify or describe how impaired the kidneys are. The kidneys can no longer do all the usual jobs at 100% of normal. </p>
    <p>The term CKD can be confusing or even alarming but it should not be. Chronic merely means it has been going for a long time (more than 3 months) and is unlikely to improve. Disease just means that the kidneys are damage by ill health. And CKD is not the same as kidney failure.</p>
