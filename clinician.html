    <h2>About eGFR</h2>
    <p>GFR is Glomerular Filtration Rate and it is a key indicator of renal function. eGFR is estimated GFR and is a mathematically derived entity based on a patient’s serum creatinine level, age, sex and race. A number of recognised and well-validated formulae have been used for this purpose including the MDRD and CKD-EPI equations. “Normal” GFR is usually >90 ml/min/1.73m2. (Note the correction for body surface area “per 1.73m2

    <h3>About CKD</h3>
    <p>A patient is said to have chronic kidney disease (CKD) if they have abnormalities of kidney function or structure present for more than 3 months. The definition of CKD includes all individuals with markers of kidney damage (see below*) or those with an eGFR of less than 60 ml/min/1.73m2 on at least 2 occasions 90 days apart (with or without markers of kidney damage).</p>
    <h2>CKD Classification</h2>
    <p>CKD is classified based on the eGFR and the level of proteinuria and helps to risk stratify patients. Patients are classified as G1-G5, based on the eGFR, and A1-A3 based on the ACR (albumin:creatinine ratio) as detailed in the chart.</p>
    <p>For Example:</p>
    <p>A person with an eGFR of 25 ml/min/1.73 m2 and an ACR of 15 mg/mmol has CKD G4A2.</p>
    <p>A person with an eGFR of 50 ml/min/1.73 m2 and an ACR of 35 mg/mmol has CKD G3aA3.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that patients with an eGFR of >60 ml/min/1.73m2 should not be classified as having CKD unless they have other markers of kidney disease (see above*).</p>
    <p>GFR category G2 may be over-diagnosed by eGFR because equations used to estimate GFR may give falsely low results in people with near-normal function. See measurement of renal function.</p>
