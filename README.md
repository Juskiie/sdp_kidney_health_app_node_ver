# sdp_kidney_health_app_node_ver

This is a project developed as part of my university coursework.

The two developers for this project were Casey (me, Juskiie), and Jason (jacixn).

It was a web application designed to allow users to calculate their eGFR values, to help prevent CKD in patients.
The runtime environment used was Node.js with the ExpressJS framework.
